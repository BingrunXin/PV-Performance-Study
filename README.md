## Short project summary
This repository contains data, analysis notebooks, firmware, and imagery produced in an empirical study of a polycrystalline photovoltaic (PV) module.  
The work is organized in two experimental phases:

- **Phase I:** Six-day monitoring with a fixed 150 Ω resistive load to quantify base performance versus environmental variables (irradiance and temperature).  
- **Phase II:** Rapid load-sweep experiments (20 Ω – 200 Ω) to empirically derive I–V and P–V characteristic curves and to locate the Maximum Power Point (MPP) under different snapshots of environmental conditions.

The primary goal is to demonstrate how irradiance and temperature influence module output and to quantify the energy loss when the module is operated at a fixed load instead of at its time-varying MPP.

## Repository contents (brief description)
This repository is organized into several purpose-specific folders:

- `analysis/` – Contains the Jupyter notebooks that reproduce the analysis and figures:
  - `pv_analysis_150ohm.ipynb` — notebook for Phase I (150 Ω).
  - `pv_analysis_20-200ohm.ipynb` — notebook for Phase II (20–200 Ω).
  Each notebook contains data-cleaning steps, plotting cells (I–V, P–V, time series), and produces the exportable figures.

- `images/` – Contains subfolders for exported figures and plots generated by the notebooks. 

- `firmware/` – Contains the microcontroller code used in the field (`main.ino`), configuration notes, and wiring comments.

- `data/` – Contains cleaned CSV files and derived summary tables:
  - `data_150ohm.csv` and `data_20-200ohm.csv` — filtered measurement data used by the notebooks.
  - `daily_summary.csv` and `blocks_summary.csv` — aggregated summaries created by the analysis notebooks.

- `report/` – Place to store report.

## How to reproduce the analysis
1. Install a Python environment with the usual data stack (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, Jupyter).  
2. Open the corresponding notebook in `analysis/` and run cells top-to-bottom to regenerate the figures (ensure `data/` files are present).  
3. Export any figures you need into `images/` (notebooks typically produce `PNG` outputs).
