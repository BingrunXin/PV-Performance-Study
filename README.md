## Abstract
This project presents the design, implementation, and analysis of a comprehensive data acquisition system built to characterize the performance of a polycrystalline silicon photovoltaic (PV) module under dynamic, real-world environmental conditions.  

The study was conducted in two distinct phases:  

- **Phase I:** A 10-day continuous monitoring period with a fixed 150 Œ© load to establish a baseline performance model correlating power output with solar irradiance and ambient temperature.  
- **Phase II:** A rapid load-scanning methodology, utilizing resistors from 20 Œ© to 200 Œ©, to empirically derive the module's Current‚ÄìVoltage (I-V) and Power‚ÄìVoltage (P-V) characteristic curves.  

Key findings:  
- Strong linear dependence of power output on irradiance.  
- Negative thermal coefficient reducing conversion efficiency.  
- Identification of the **Maximum Power Point (MPP)** under different conditions.  
- Quantification of a significant **‚Äúmismatch loss‚Äù (~25‚Äì30%)** between fixed-load operation and the true MPP, validating the importance of **Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT)**.  
- Development of fault-tolerant firmware for reliable long-term operation.

## 1. Introduction
Photovoltaics (PV) are central to the global renewable energy transition. However, real-world PV performance deviates significantly from **Standard Test Conditions (STC)** due to environmental variability.  

This project set out to **bridge the gap between theory and field performance**, with four primary objectives:  

1. Design and deploy a robust multi-sensor data acquisition system.  
2. Quantify the relationship between irradiance, temperature, and module power under a fixed load.  
3. Empirically measure I-V and P-V curves to identify the MPP.  
4. Quantify energy ‚Äúmismatch loss‚Äù to highlight the role of MPPT technology.
